    "\n",
    "A generic Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) firm has begun offering \n",
    "a new “Pay in 5 Installments” feature. Merchants are looking to form a partnership as it may boost their customer base, the BNPL firm in return gets a small percentage of revenue to cover their operating cost. However, the BNPL firm can only onboard at most 100 < X number of merchants every year due to limited resources. Hence, we will design a ranking system for the merchants to assist the firm in selecting merchants that they should accept.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Overview of our insight in producing the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "As a **firm that has just begun their business**, we believe that their business goals is to **earn profit while \n",
    "maintaining a long-term establishment of their business**. Hence, when selecting merchants we believe that the monetary worth of cashflows which a merchant can bring for the BNPL firm is not the sole criterion for this new firm picking business partners.\n",
    "\n",
    "High returns may come with high risks, merchants could be making a 100,000 in a month and is out of business for the rest of the year, this could possibly impact the cash flow in the BNPL firm. As a new establish firm may not have a stable cash flow, this may hinder the objective of staying in business for a long-term and create financial risk, hence, we aim to select merchants that provide a **stable return**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, as a newly establish firm, we believe that the firm **may not have a large and strong consumer base that uses their services**. Hence, merchants with a young customer demographic and other features (explained in Ranking model assumption) are also consider when creating a ranking system for the merchant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, our solution is based on our domain knowledge in Finance and Economics which give intutions of what goals the firm may have, and hopes to **maintain a stable profit to allow the firm to stay in operation but also help expand the firm for better revenues in the future**."

    "##### 3.3.1 Dealing with consumer fraud\n",
    "\n",
    "We treated this problem as a supervised learning problem, with labels being predicted fraud probability. We chose to use the continuous predicting model of random forest regressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "We treated each consumer-day (i.e. each row in the fraud dataset) as an instance, and engineered variables such as the average transaction amount on that day by that consumer; the sd of transaction amounts on the day by that customer; the number of transactions they had; and number of distinct stores they shopped at. All these were derived by joining fraud dataset with transaction dataset and then aggregating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Four other variables were also engineered: i.e. number of distinct stores they shopped at on day of being labelled / average number of distinct stores they shopped at in the past days when they made at least one transaction. The same idea was implemented for the other three variables. The latter 4 variables are expected to give a ratio that standardises each consumer-day by the consumer's historic behaviour, to make different consumers more comparable. They are denoted by appending the word 'ratio' behind the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, 'transaction amount per order ratio', 'transaction amount per order', 'sd of transaction amounts on the day', 'sd of transaction amounts on the day ratio' were chosen as variables.\n",

The Sharpe Ratio is a finance concept which for our problem equals to E( (revenue * take rate) of the whole portfolio ) / sd( (revenue * take rate) of the whole portfolio ). The purpose of using this metric is because as a company, having high incoming cashflow is of course predominantly good, but if high cashflows come with high variance, this could put the buisiness at financial risk, which brings along implicit bankruptcy costs etc; by using the Sharpe Ratio to evaluate the portfolio of 100 companies, we can guarentee that we have maximised the amount of incoming cashflow from merchant revenue * take rate for all the risk (standard deviation) we have chosen. \n",

    "\n",
    "- As stated above, we do not have a risk free rate; also we do not need to put in initial investment amount (it is like getting to invest in 100 stocks for free), so instead of using E(return rate) and sd(return rate) etc which what finance analysts do, we use E(revenue * take rate) and sd(revenue * take rate)\n",

However, here, our portfolio's 'weights' add up to 100, and each merchant's weight can only ever be 1.

This is because the data provided only spans 18 months, which is 39 fortnights, and if splitting into three parts will likely hurt the model more than the overfit component. "

    "The signs of the first two variables' coefficients are not surprising, given that sharpe ratios are higher when mean are higher and standard deviation is lower. The signs on correlation's coefficient is more surprising - we expected it to be negative given in probability theory, having lower/negative correlation helps lower the standard deviation of the sum of random variables (in this case random variables being revenue of each merchant). Also, using intuition, we would perhaps hope that the firms would be uncorrelated with the market so that the firm's incomes are stable and are less affected by external factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "One possible explanation is that the model has not put much emphasis on the historic mean variable (as seen by its small correlation coefficient compared to other variables - even after considering that its typical values are much larger than other variables), and so the correlation with the 'market' is in fact capturing information of high (revenue * take rate) which is also important for a high sharpe ratio. In short, it may be that in driving for high sharpe ratio, the emphasis has been placed on lower standard deviation, and instead the high numerator (mean revenue * take rate) part is captured in the correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "An explanation for the negative loyalty rate is that BNPL is more reliant on firms that attract new customers rather than retaining old customers. This is because, a loyal customer may be beneficial to the merchant as they generate consistent revenue for them, however, as a BNPL firm if such customer rejects our service after we selected the merchant, such merchant will not generate as much revenue as we hoped. Hence, the model favours merchant that has more \"un-loyal\" customers and hence could reduce our advertisement cost while reaching out to more customers.\n",
